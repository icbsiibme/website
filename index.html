              >Dr. Ajit P. Yoganathan is the Wallace H. Coulter Distinguished
              Faculty Chair and Associate Chair for Translational Research in
              the Wallace H. Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering and a
              Regents’ professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and
              Emory University. He is also the founder and the Director of the
              Center for Innovative Cardiovascular Technologies. He received a
              Bachelor of Science and a Doctor of Philosophy in Chemical
              Engineering in 1973 from University College, University of London
              and in 1978 from the California Institute of Technology,
              respectively. Since joining the faculty at Georgia Tech in 1979,
              Dr. Yoganathan has made significant professional contributions at
              both the national and international levels, and a played a key
              role in the creation of the master’s and Ph.D. degrees in
              bioengineering and the joint Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering with
              the Emory University School of Medicine. Dr. Yoganathan’s 40+ year
              research career has been pioneering and translational in nature by
              applying basic engineering science to develop meaningful human
              health outcomes, specifically in the realm of cardiovascular
              engineering and biology. In his effort to take an
              interdisciplinary and translational approach to his research, Dr.
              Yoganathan has established collaborations with clinicians,
              scientists, and industry professionals world-wide. His work
              utilizes experimental and computational biomechanical techniques
              to study native and artificial heart valves, structure function of
              the left and right sides of the heart, congenital heart diseases,
              and to develop minimally invasive cardiovascular interventions. He
              also uses non-invasive techniques such as laser Doppler
              velocimetry, digital particle image velocimetry, and Doppler
              ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging to study and quantify
              blood flow physiology in the cardiovascular system, both on the
              bench and in vivo. His research success has led to more than 400
              peer reviewed journal articles in leading biomedical journals and
              more than 40 book chapters. He has also been an invited speaker to
              over 70 conferences/seminar around the world and has mentored more
              than 50 doctoral students, 35 masters’ students, and 30
              post-doctoral trainees. Dr. Yoganathan’s career has been
              distinguished by a number of high honors. In 1985, Dr. Yoganathan
              was awarded an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship from West Germany
              to spend 9 months at the Helmholtz Institute for Biomedical
              Engineering, Technical University of Aachen. He received the Edwin
              Walker Prize from the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, UK in
              1988. In 1992, he was elected a founding fellow of the American
              Institute of Medical and Biological Engineering. The same year, he
              also spent six months at the University of Aarhus, Denmark as a
              Visiting Professor of the Danish Research Academy. He received the
              H.R. Lissner Award, for his contributions to the field of
              bioengineering in 1997 from the American Society of Mechanical
              Engineers. In 2005, he was awarded the Theo Pilkington Award, for
              his contributions to Biomedical Engineering education by the
              American Society of Engineering Education. That same year he was
              also appointed Chair of the Cardiovascular Sub-Committee (SC2),
              International Standards Organization Technical Committee (TC 150)
              on Implants for Surgery. In 2010 he was appointed the Founding
              Editor in Chief of Cardiovascular Engineering and Technology - the
              newest journal of the Biomedical Engineering Society which in 2015
              was accepted to PubMed and received an impact factor of 1.064 in
              2017. In 2012, he was selected to be the Biomedical Engineering
              Society’s Pritzker Lecturer Award, one of the highest honors given
              to a BMES Member. In 2012 he was also awarded the Ann Newman
              Lecturer Award from the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP)
              - the only engineer to have been awarded this honor. In 2015, in
              recognition of his significant contributions to the field of
              engineering, he was elected to the prestigious National Academy of
              Engineers in Washington, D.C. For his leadership and work on
              International and US standards on cardiovascular medical devices,
              he was presented the 2015 Standards Developer Award from the
              Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. In
              February of 2017 he was awarded the Tamils’ Information Lifetime
              Achievement Award, presented to him by the mayor of Toronto at
              City Hall in Toronto, Canada. Additionally, Dr. Yoganathan has
              been active in inventing and developing a variety of medical
              devices and currently has 16 issued U.S. patents, with another 5
              patent applications under review. In October 2009 he licensed one
              of his patents on heart valve repair, of which he is co-inventor,
              to a major cardiovascular medical device company (Edwards
              Lifesciences). The device is currently in animal studies. In
              November of 2009 he co-founded APICA Cardiovascular using other
              co-invented intellectual property. APICA is situated in Galway,
              Ireland, with an engineering research office in Atlanta, GA. The
              company raised USD $5.5 million in venture capital funds. The
              company’s first product, a “bloodless” ventricular access and
              closure device, received CE mark approval in Fall 2013. APICA was
              acquired in July 2014 by Thoratec (the largest left ventricular
              assist device manufacturer) for USD $75 million. Another one of
              his inventions, a children’s continuous renal replacement therapy
              device, is currently under further development and initial animal
              studies, funded by a NIH challenge grant and a FDA pediatric
              device center grant have started. The impact of his contributions
              to clinicians is profound, especially in the area of congenital
              heart diseases. The surgical planning tool he envisioned together
              with Prof. Jarek Rossignac, called SURGEM, is one such practical
              application of fluid mechanics in treating kids born with half a
              heart (single ventricle). This anomaly occurs in 2 in 1000 of
              every child born in the USA and 4 in 1000 in China. As part of
              this pioneering and translational work, he - together with Dr.
              Kanter, Chief of Pediatric Cardiac Surgery at Emory and The
              Children’s Hospital of Atlanta (CHOA) - developed the Y-graft
              surgical operation in 2011, based on his Optiflo patent. The
              Y-graft operation was listed as one of the top innovations in 2013
              by CHOA and has since been used in about 50 plus children in
              Atlanta, the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and Stanford
              University Children’s Hospital. Dr. Yoganathan also regularly
              works with medical device regulatory organizations. Since 1979 he
              has worked with the FDA and in 2004 he was appointed Chair of the
              International Standards Organization committee for implantable
              cardiovascular devices. This later appointment was a major
              achievement/honor which recognizes research contributions and
              leadership in the field of cardiovascular medical devices at an
              international level. This leadership appointment has major
              implications with respect to international standards work as well
              as the US national standards and further interactions with the
              Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Union (EU)
              community. During decades of research on heart valves, he has also
              worked with every manufacturer that has a replacement valve on the
              American market, including St. Jude Medical, Edwards Lifesciences,
              Medtronic, Carbomedics, Sorin Biomedical, and Boston Scientific,
              as well as with a number of smaller (including start-up)
              biomedical companies. It is worth noting that all prosthetic heart
              valves in use in U.S. (since 1975) have been evaluated in Dr.
              Yoganathan’s lab either directly or indirectly. Additionally, he
              consults with the major CV imaging companies, such as Philips, GE
              and Siemens.</strong

              the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the Johns
              Hopkins University Krieger School of Arts and Sciences. Dr. Ewen
              attended Brown University and Tulane University School of
              Medicine, from which he graduated in 2000. He received training in
              general pediatrics at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical
              Center and then was one of the first graduates of the Kennedy
              Krieger/Johns Hopkins program in neurodevelopmental disabilities.
              He subsequently took a year of training in specialized training in
              clinical neurophysiology/epilepsy (Johns Hopkins). He is currently
              a neurologist and developmental paediatrician at Kennedy Krieger,
              where he sees patients with autism. He also interprets clinical
              EEGs at Kennedy Krieger’s Clinical Neurophysiology Laboratory and
              Epilepsy Monitoring Unit, of which he is medical director. A large
              portion of his effort is focused on research into the cognitive
              alterations in developmental disabilities. Dr. Ewen's research
              involves the use of behavioural and EEG-based techniques to study
              developmental disabilities and basic questions within psychology
              and neuroscience. His current primary work focuses on the
              borderlands between cognition and motor control in autism, but he
              also has ongoing research in ADHD. He has strong collaborations
              with neuroengineers and signal processing experts. He is further
              focused on the process for developing and validating biomarkers.
