             Dr. Arthur McClelland is a technical staff in a core facility at Harvard University supporting researchers across many disciplines including physics, chemistry, material science, electrical engineering, molecular biology, cell biology, archaeology, library and art conservation, geology, and zoology with materials characterization techniques. He provides technical training and scientific consultation about the information that can be obtained from a sample through optical microscopy and optical spectroscopy techniques. He supports more than 500 active users in their research endeavours annually. He supports all areas of science from archeology to zoology. The primary techniques that he is responsible for are Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, UV-VIS spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and various forms of optical microscopy. (DIC, polarised, phase contrast, fluorescent, confocal, hyperspectral imaging, etc.) He has secondary responsibility for the micro computed tomography (uCT) and X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS).  He is one of thirty technical staff at the Center for Nanoscale Systems (CNS) at Harvard University. CNS is the largest core lab at Harvard with 1,500+ users annually using the facilities. CNS consists of a 10,000 sqft clean room for nanofabrication, fifteen electron microscopy suites, and five material characterization labs. He works on the materials characterization side supporting about 450 active users annually. He is responsible for training users on the scientific instruments, helping users with experimental design, and troubleshooting and repairing the scientific instruments. The primary techniques he is responsible for are Raman spectroscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy, UV-VIS absorption, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and various forms of optical microscopy.

            <strong>Dr. David Belo is a Portuguese Biomedical Engineer with a vast and multidisciplinary experience. His career choice was made based on two passions: health and the human body; and technology and development. The evolution of computers, graphics and robotics combined with deeper understanding of human nature, both physically and psychologically, highly motivates him. His goal is to unite these passions and make something new. David Belo received his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from the NOVA University of Lisbon in 2021 in applying deep learning algorithms for several biosignals' paradigms. He has always been involved in both academia and industry after finishing his Master's Degree from the University of Minho in 2007. The research activity was mainly in biosignal processing and machine learning to extract meaningful information and make automatic decision support systems, and, on the industry side, he earned experience in programming mobile applications, reporting services, and administration software. In addition to this, he has participated in the summer of 2019 in the NASA Frontier Development Lab in developing AI tools for aiding the Astronaut Health program. Currently, he is working at Fraunhofer AICOS as a Senior Scientist while managing and developing R&D projects for applications using machine learning, namely creating solutions for healthcare. He cares about self-development because he truly believes that solving my own issues teaches how to help others. He gives his all when facing challenges, and his creativity and persistence helps, not only him, but also his teams to find original solutions. Leadership is also one of his strong aspects due to his easy-going, altruistic and humorous personality. He does believe that everyone in a team has a role (including the leader), so everyone in the team should be in a circle where everyone contributes with their skill or passion. <br />
